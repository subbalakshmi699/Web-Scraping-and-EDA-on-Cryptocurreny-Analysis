# Web-Scraping-and-EDA-on-Cryptocurreny-Analysis
Web-Scraping-and-EDA-on-Cryptocurrency-Analysis is a data science project that explores the world of cryptocurrencies through web scraping and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The project focuses on gathering data from various online sources related to cryptocurrencies and using this data to gain insights into the market trends and patterns.

In this project, we will start by using Python to scrape data from cryptocurrency website  CoinGecko. We will then use various data analysis and visualization techniques to explore and understand the data, including descriptive statistics, time series analysis, and correlation analysis.

Our goal is to gain insights into the cryptocurrency market, including the behavior of different cryptocurrencies, their prices, and the factors that influence their prices. This project will be useful for anyone interested in learning more about the cryptocurrency market and how to use web scraping and EDA techniques to analyze data.
